# Spectrogram
This application indirectly relies a node-sass version which [does not support Node >=12](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1763#issuecomment-497138736). You should run this using Node 11; one way to accomplish this is with nvm:
- nvm install 11
- nvm use 11

Once you have a sufficiently old Node version setup:
- Clone the repo
- Run :$ sudo npm install
- Run :$ gulp build-all
- Run :$ gulp
